# sentiment-analysis
Welcome to my NLP repository, containing a collection of basic preprocessing and sentiment analysis codes. This repository aims to provide easy-to-use code for anyone interested in natural language processing tasks such as cleaning and preparing text data, and analyzing sentiment. The codes are implemented in Python and can be easily integrated into your NLP project.

The preprocessing scripts include functions to remove stop words, punctuation, and numbers, as well as to tokenize and lemmatize text. The sentiment analysis scripts utilize the Vader sentiment lexicon and calculate polarity scores for text inputs.

Feel free to use these scripts for your own NLP projects, and please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding!
